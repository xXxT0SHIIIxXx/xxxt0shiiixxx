                For years now, I've needed a website to host all of my work badly. I always dreamt of coding my own website to show off my ability to grasp new concepts.
                Coding websites was always very complicated when I dove into it, It's not something I'm particularly interested in doing, and I felt confused by the endless tools,
                libraries, and resources to help build your own website but not immediately coding your own website.
            </p>

            <p class="txt__sm col__primary">I tried multiple times to build this website. I did some online courses for HTML, CSS, and JS. I watched endless videos on the topic. Every Attempt result in a failure. I was determined but kept hitting walls.</p>

            <p class="txt__med col__accent">Caving into the need...</p>
            <p class="txt__sm col__primary">Finally, I broke through. I'm unsure what changed this time. Maybe it's skill, experience, and perserverance that got me through this. Maybe it was just pure luck and I'm fine with either one at this point. I'm just
            happy to have finally gotten through this project and I actually am very happy with the process and end result.</p>

            <p class="txt__sm col__primary">Thank you for taking your time to read this. I plan to post more here as much as I can to document my journey through the creatives.</p>
